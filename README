requires ivtv-utils
sudo apt-get install ivtv-utils

This is a very simple script that finds your HDPVR device and changes the audio input and/or audio encoding on a Hauppauge HDPVR.

The settings may reset when the unit is unplugged from power, unplugged from USB or even on a reboot.

So, this could be run on startup (with options) or can be run manually.

Options are currently 0-4 and can only be called one at a time.

examples:
./HDPVR-config		# this will prompt the user for input and shows the current audio configuration
./HDPVR-config 0	# this sets the unit's default input to RCA (back) (normal unit default)
./HDPVR-config 1	# this sets the unit's default input to RCA (front)
./HDPVR-config 2	# this sets the unit's default input to optical/spdif
./HDPVR-config 3	# this sets the unit's default audio encoding to aac (normal unit default)
./HDPVR-config 4	# this sets the unit's default audio encoding to ac3
